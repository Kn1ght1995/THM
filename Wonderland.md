poem = """The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright â€”
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done â€”
"Itâ€™s very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"

The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying over head â€”
There were no birds to fly.
